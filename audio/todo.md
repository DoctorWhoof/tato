[x] "queue_volume", "queue_frequency", "queue_pan" as a way to only allow changes at the end of each wave cycle.
    . Will need a cycle counter reinstated. (can be zeroed out every time the wave cycles, queues are only applied if counter is zero!)
    . Frequency is applied instantly, but volume and pan are queued.
