Ridiculous old fashioned game engine. Don't use this unless you're slightly insane.

Features:
- Minimal dependencies (slotmap, libm). No standard library required.
- Old school, tile based, software renderer with up to (but no more than) 256 colors.
- Basic AABB collisions with reactions.
- Minimal runtime. This thing can't even read a PNG! Check "tato_pipe" for a way to convert PNG graphics into binary data at build time.
