# Tato Game Development Tools

### Warning: In early development, please don't use yet!

Tato (as in "po-tato-powered") is a collection of zero dependencies, zero allocation, NO_STD libraries for game development, mostly focused on Pixel Art & Chiptunes. **It is not an engine**, and has a minimalist philosophy that embraces explicit limitations over flexibility.

It encompasses:

- **Tato Video**, a "fantasy video chip" that operates like an early 1980's video chip.
- **Tato Sound**, a "fantasy audio chip". *Not uploaded yet*!
- **Tato Pad**, a way to store the state of a gamepad and perform checks.
- **Tato Layout**, a GUI layout library.
